                An autobiography, most often published as a book, is the story of someone's life written by that actual person themselves. Their life stories can be ones of struggle and hardship, but also of triumph and resilience. Here follow several examples of inspiring autobiographies worth reading, plus a sample short autobiography essay, to perhaps prompt you to write your own story. <span> <a href="about.html">Read More-></a></span>

                        "They were ill trained and poorly led. Theirs is the glory of Bataan which nobody recognized and everybody wants to claim.
                        These boys were in the front lines without relief for 3 months. Ill fed, ill equipped and poorly trained. However, they stood their 
                        ground notwithstanding all this and the lack of leadership and training officers.
                        History and MacArthur may decide who was the merit. To me it was the courage of the Filipino defending his country and his own.‚Äù
